When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-> When multiple persons are contributing from remote locations
-> When I don't want to carry my home pc at all time

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-> Automatically does not actually server the purpose because pulling and pushing should be done when actual,meaningful stage has been reached by the programmer. Automatic may develop two scenarios:
  -> by time: at specific time when the system pulls/pushes, the change might not have been finalized
  -> pushing.pulling with commit made: while commit made indicates a logical chang has been made, it still does not indicate the code being read for syncing

->branches: in local or in github to independently do task
